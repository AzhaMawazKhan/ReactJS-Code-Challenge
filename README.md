It was an easy todo task ,there were other solutions to my mind but I tried to follow the flow of the code and used the recomendend tools to complete my tasks.


I have rebuild the database in store.js for multiple lists , by doing so I faced multi dimentional arrays in state which I know is not the best practice to do but I have to follow the flow of the code.


Thanks for consideration.
